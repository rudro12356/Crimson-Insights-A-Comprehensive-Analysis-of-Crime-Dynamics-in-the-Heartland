A Social Data Science Analysis of Education, Housing, Race/Ethnicity, and Occupation Dynamics in Kansas

Our project aims to conduct a comprehensive social data science analysis focusing on key aspects of Kansas society, including education, housing, race/ethnicity, and occupation data. By synthesizing information from reliable sources such as government databases, educational institutions, and census data, we seek to uncover intricate patterns, correlations, and insights that shed light on the social dynamics within the state. Through a combination of statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques, we hope to provide a nuanced understanding of these interrelated factors, enabling informed decision-making and potentially identifying areas for improvement or intervention.
